# Finance-data-capstone-project
A data analysis and visualization of stock prices of certain banks from 2006 to 2016. Refer to the file named 'my output' to see the outputs produced for the codes I wrote. Most of the output defer from those in the finance project file as I used yahoo as the data source for the stock prices. Google was no longer implemented
